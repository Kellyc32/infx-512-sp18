<h2>My favorite version of the most classic tres leches cake subs out buttermilk for the whole milk.
I love the subtle tange it adds and how it makes the cake itself a little less rich, meaning I can 
really load up on the whipped cream topping later.A vanilla cake with a tangy whip cream frosting which is lightly sprinkled with cinnamon.</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Cake:</h4>
<ul>
<li>12 tablespoons (170g) unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups (297g) granulated sugar</li>
<li>7 large (397g) eggs</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons (7g) vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 1/4 cups (271g) all purpose floor</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons (6g) backing powder</li>
<li>3/4 teaspoon (3g) fine sea salt</li>
</ul>
<h5>Soaking:</h5>
<ul>
<li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
<li>one (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
<li>one (12 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
<li>Lightly sweetened whipped cream, as needed for finishing</li>
<li>Ground cinnamon, as needed for finishing</li>
</ul>
<h6>Method</h6>
<ul>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 F. Lightly greas a 9x13 pan with nonstick spray.
<li>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter 
    and sugar until light and fluffy, 4-5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the eggs one at a time and mix well to combine. Add the vanilla and mix to incorporate.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt to combine. Add the mixture to the mixer
    and mix just until incorporated. Scrape well to ensure the batter is evenly combined.</li>
<li>Pour the mixture into the prepared baking pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center
    comes out clean, 38-40 minutes. Let cool completely.</li>
<li>Poke the cake all over with a wooden skewer. In a large container, preferably one with a pour spout,
    whisk the buttermilk, sweetened condensed milk, and evaporated milk to combine.</li>
<li>Gently pour the mixture all over the cake, letting it soak in through the holes. Most of this will happen
    quickly, but if some liquid pools up anywhere on the surface of the cake, just spoon
    it back over the cake until the mixure is absorbed (let it sit for about 30 minutes).</li>
<li>Finish the cake with the whipped cream and a sprinkle of ground cinnamon. Serve immediately,
    or refrigerate for up to 5 hours before serving.</li>
</ul>
